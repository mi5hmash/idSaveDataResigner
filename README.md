# 🆔 idSaveDataResigner - What is it :interrobang:
This application can **encrypt and decrypt SaveData files** from various games running on idTech Engine versions 7 and 8. It can also **re-sign SaveData files** with your own User ID so you can **use anyone’s SaveData on your User Account**.

## Supported titles
|Game Title|Platform|App ID|Game Code|
|---|---|---|---|
|DOOM Eternal|Steam|782330|MANCUBUS|
|DOOM The Dark Ages|Steam|3017860|MANCUBUS|
|Indiana Jones and the Great Circle|Steam|2677660|SUKHOTHAI|
|Indiana Jones and the Great Circle|GOG|-|PAINELEMENTAL|

## 🔄 Note about the conversion between the Steam and GOG platforms
In the case of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle game, the GOG platform uses a different Game Code than the Steam version, along with a fixed User ID. 
To convert SaveData files between these two platforms, you must first decrypt the files using the appropriate Game Code and User ID for the source platform, and then encrypt them using the Game Code and User ID of the target platform.

# 🤯 Why was it created :interrobang:
I wanted to share a SaveData file with a friend, but it isn't possible by default.

# :scream: Is it safe?
The short answer is: **No.** 
> [!CAUTION]
> If you unreasonably edit your SaveData files, you risk corrupting them or getting banned from playing online. In both cases, you will lose your progress.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always create a backup of any files before editing them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disable the Steam Cloud before you replace any SaveData files.

You’ve been warned. Now that you fully understand the possible consequences, you may proceed to the next chapter.

# :scroll: How to use this tool
## [GUI] - 🪟 Windows 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you’re working on Linux or macOS, skip this chapter and move on to the next one.

On Windows, you can use either the CLI or the GUI version, but in this chapter I’ll describe the latter.

<img src="https://github.com/mi5hmash/idSaveDataResigner/blob/main/.resources/images/MainWindow-v2.png" alt="MainWindow-v2"/>

#### 1. Selecting the Game Profile
Game Profile is a configuration file that stores the settings for a specific game.
In plain terms, it tells my application how it should behave for that particular game.
I include a package with ready‑to‑use Game Profile files (**profiles.zip**) in the release section.
The ***"_profiles"*** folder inside that package, containing the Game Profile files, should be placed in the same directory as the program’s executable.
Button **(2)** opens the local ***"_profiles"*** folder.

#### 2. Setting the Input Directory
You can set the input folder in whichever way feels most convenient:
- **Drag & drop:** Drop SaveData file - or the folder containing it - onto the TextBox **(3)**.
- **Pick a folder manually:** Click the button **(4)** to open a folder‑picker window and browse to the directory where SaveData file is.
- **Type it in:** If you already know the path, simply enter it directly into the TextBox **(3)**.

#### 3. Entering the User ID
In the case of Steam, your User ID is 64-bit SteamID.  
One way to find it is by using the SteamDB calculator at [steamdb.info](https://steamdb.info/calculator/).

#### 4. Re-signing SaveData files
If you want to re‑sign your SaveData file/s so it works on another Steam account, select the Game Profile **(1)** corresponding to the game from which the save file comes. Once you have it selected, type the User ID of the account that originally created that SaveData file/s into the TextBox **(5)**. Then enter the User ID of the account that should be allowed to use that SaveData file/s into the TextBox **(7)**. Finally, press the **"Re-sign All"** button **(11)**.

> [!NOTE]
> The re‑signed files will be placed in a newly created folder within the ***"idSaveDataResigner/_OUTPUT/"*** folder.

#### 5. Accessing modified files
Modified files are being placed in a newly created folder within the ***"idSaveDataResigner/_OUTPUT/"*** folder. You may open this directory in a new File Explorer window by pressing the button **(12)**.

> [!NOTE]
> After you locate the modified files, you can copy them into your save‑game folder.

### ADVANCED OPERATIONS

#### Enabling SuperUser Mode

> [!WARNING]
> This mode is for advanced users only.

If you really need it, you can enable SuperUser mode by triple-clicking the version number label **(13)**.

#### Decrypting SaveData files

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This button is visible only when the SuperUser Mode is Enabled. 

If you want to decrypt SaveData file\s to read its content, select the Game Profile **(1)** corresponding to the game from which the SaveData file comes, type the User ID of the account that originally created that SaveData file/s into the TextBox **(5)**, and press the **"Decrypt All"** button **(8)**.

#### Encrypting SaveData files

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This button is visible only when the SuperUser Mode is Enabled. 

If you want to encrypt the decrypted SaveData file\s, select the Game Profile **(5)** corresponding to the game from which the SaveData file comes, enter the User ID of the account that should be allowed to use that SaveData file/s into the TextBox **(7)**, and press the **"Encrypt All"** button **(9)**.

### OTHER BUTTONS
Button **(10)** cancels the currently running operation.
Button **(6)** swaps the values in the **"User ID (INPUT)"** and **"User ID (OUTPUT)"** TextBoxes.

# :fire: Issues
All the problems I've encountered during my tests have been fixed on the go. If you find any other issues (which I hope you won't) feel free to report them [there](https://github.com/mi5hmash/idSaveDataResigner/issues).

> [!TIP]
> This application creates a log file that may be helpful in troubleshooting.  
It can be found in the same directory as the executable file.  
Application stores up to two log files from the most recent sessions.
